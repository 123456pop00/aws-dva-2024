# Cognito

> **Cognito** provides a high-level, easy-to-use service for user authentication and user data management

#### 1. **Cognito User Pool** üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

* **Cognito User Pool** is fully managed serverless auth service
  * charged for both **underlying storage** and **API calls**
  * Charges based on the number of **monthly active users (MAUs)** that interact with your User Pool. A **monthly active user (MAU)** is defined as a user who has logged in, signed up, or otherwise interacted with your User Pool within a given month.
  * **Free Tier**: 50,000 MAUs per month for CUP  and a generous amount of API calls (for most use cases).
  * **Paid Tier**: Beyond the free tier, you **pay for each additional MAU** and for API calls (sign-ups, logins, etc.). Pricing varies by region, but it typically starts at around **$0.0055 per MAU** (this can change based on region and the specific type of interaction).&#x20;
  * Sign-up, sign-in, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) API calls are usually priced at $0.03 per 1,000 API calls.
* Social Login via Google, Fb, SAML, OpenID Connect
* JWT support to validate user access to backend stuff
* MFA support
* Integrates with ALB (acts as reverse proxy)and API GW (offload validation)
  * ALB is configured with action to Authenticate Cognito and has HTTPS listener
* Blocks users whos creds been compromised
* It provides functionality for user **sign-up**, **sign-in**, and **account recovery**.
* It also supports storing **custom user attributes** (e.g., `phone number`, `address`, `roles`, etc.) that you can define at the time of pool creation.

**Key points**:

* The **underlying storage** (which is a database) is **managed by AWS**. You don't have direct access to it.
* Instead of querying the database directly (like you would with DynamoDB), you interact with **Cognito APIs** to manage users, retrieve attributes, and handle authentication.

#### 2. **Accessing User Data with Cognito** üîë

* **Cognito APIs** let you interact with the user data stored in the **User Pool**. For example, you can:
  * **Get user details** (via `adminGetUser` or `getUser`).
  * **Modify attributes** (via `adminUpdateUserAttributes`).
  * **Authenticate users** (via `initiateAuth` for login).

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const cognito = new AWS.CognitoIdentityServiceProvider();

// Get user attributes using getUser API
const params = {
  AccessToken: 'ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE' // Get from user after login
};

cognito.getUser(params, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    console.log("Error fetching user attributes", err);
  } else {
    console.log("User attributes:", data);
  }
});
```

* You would use the `AccessToken` or `IdToken` to authenticate and query the user information from the **Cognito User Pool**.

#### 3. **Custom Attributes** ‚úèÔ∏è

You can **add custom attributes** (like `roles`, `preferences`, etc.) to user profiles in Cognito. These are stored in Cognito's user data store, but you cannot query this database directly like you would with DynamoDB.

```javascript
//adding custom attributes
const params = {
  UserPoolId: 'userPoolId',
  Username: 'user@example.com',
  UserAttributes: [
    {
      Name: 'custom:role',
      Value: 'admin'
    }
  ]
};

cognito.adminUpdateUserAttributes(params, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error updating user attributes:", err);
  } else {
    console.log("User attributes updated successfully:", data);
  }
});
```

#### 4. **Lambda Triggers with Cognito** üßë‚Äçüíª

* You can also set up **Lambda triggers** in Cognito to perform actions at various stages of the user authentication flow, such as during **sign-up**, **pre-sign-up validation**, or **post-confirmation**.
* These Lambda triggers allow you to modify user data during the flow or invoke additional logic.

**Post Confirmation** trigger:

```javascript
 // welcome email or log user info
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  console.log("User confirmed:", event);
  return event;
};
```

#### 5. **Cognito vs DynamoDB** ü§î

* **DynamoDB** is a general-purpose NoSQL database, and you have complete control over the schema, structure, and queries.
* **Cognito**, on the other hand, is a fully managed authentication service that abstracts away much of the complexity of managing user identities, password policies, and authentication flows.

If you want **direct access to user data** and want to control the database and schema yourself, **DynamoDB** is a better choice. However, if you're just managing user authentication and don't need to manage the underlying database directly, **Cognito** is the better option.

**Types of Tokens:**

* **ID Token (`id_token`)**: Contains identity information about the authenticated user, like name and email. This token is typically used by the frontend to personalize the experience for the user.
* **Access Token (`access_token`)**: Contains information about the permissions and roles granted to the user. This is typically used for authorization to access AWS services or custom backend services.
* **Refresh Token (`refresh_token`)**: Used to obtain new ID and Access tokens when the old ones expire.
